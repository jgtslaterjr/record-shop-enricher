That's why millions of people choose DuckDuckGo over Chrome and other browsers to search and browse online. Our built-in search engine is like Google but never tracks your searches. And our browsing protections, such as ad tracker blocking and cookie blocking, help stop other companies from collecting your data. Oh, and our browser is free — we make money from privacy-respecting search ads, not by exploiting your data. Take back control of your personal information with the browser designed for data protection, not data collection. Learn moreHow does DuckDuckGo protect my privacy?If you’re like most people on the Internet, you use Google to search the web and Google Chrome to browse the web. That means, by default, Google can keep track of every single search you make and website you visit. On those websites, other companies may also track you.DuckDuckGo is an independent Google alternative that also lets you search and browse the web, but we don’t track your searches or browsing history, and our browsers and extensions help you block other companies from trying to track you as well, all by default. Our free browser comes with seamless protection built-in, including tracker blocking, increased encryption, email protection, and more, making it the most comprehensive protection you can get with one download. Plus, DuckDuckGo subscribers get four additional features: a fast and simple VPN, access to advanced AI models in Duck.ai, a Personal Information Removal service, and an Identity Theft Restoration service. That’s how DuckDuckGo helps protect you in a nutshell. Learn moreDoes DuckDuckGo block all trackers on websites I visit?DuckDuckGo never tracks you. And when you leave our search engine and use our browsers or extensions to visit other sites, we aim to protect your privacy as much as possible. No service can eliminate all hidden tracking or all profiling online because trackers are always trying to evade specific protections. To be effective, our protections continually evolve to mitigate this while avoiding website breakage. That’s also why we offer multiple types of web tracking protections.Other browsers offer some of these by default, like cookie and fingerprinting protections, but we also provide many other protections that most browsers do not offer by default, like 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection, Global Privacy Control, Link Tracking Protection, CNAME Cloaking Protection, Google AMP Protection, and more, which all help cover different tracking angles. Our list of trackers is open source, along with the list of exceptions we make to preserve usability. Learn moreHow many people use DuckDuckGo?Our best guess — over 100 million people! We don’t track our users, so it’s impossible for us to know how many people in total actually use our product. However, we can make an estimate based on the number of searches we get each month. Thanks to all these users, DuckDuckGo holds the #2 position in mobile search market share in the US, and 20 other markets including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Poland, Italy, and Spain.How does DuckDuckGo make money?We make money from private ads on our search engine. On other search engines, ads are based on profiles compiled from your personal information, such as search, browsing, and purchase history. We don’t have that information (per our Privacy Policy) because search ads on DuckDuckGo are based on the search results page you’re viewing instead of on what other companies’ tracking algorithms assume about you. For example, if you search for cars, we’ll show you ads about cars. We also make money from the paid DuckDuckGo subscription, our four-in-one subscription service. Learn moreWhy use DuckDuckGo instead of Google?Use DuckDuckGo to help protect yourself online. Ever get ads so creepy it feels like your phone is listening to you? Or see ads for something you searched for once following you around everywhere? If you’re wondering who to blame, it’s probably Google. For decades, they’ve been tracking your searches, embedding trackers in their Chrome browser, and hiding even more trackers on the most-popular websites. This type of mass collection of your personal information can make you vulnerable to hackers, scammers, and other privacy-invasive companies.DuckDuckGo lets you search and browse like you’re used to, but (unlike Google) we never track you and our browser helps block trackers from companies that run online tracking networks like Google, TikTok, and Meta (Facebook). Oh, and our browser is free — we make money from privacy-respecting search ads, not by exploiting your data.Use DuckDuckGo to get a better online experience. Have you noticed Google search results getting worse? You’re not alone. For many Google searches, most of the results on the first page are either ads or Google pushing their own services. It can be even worse on mobile.On DuckDuckGo, we keep ads to a minimum and our sear",

If so, you may have noticed a few changes around here! As you navigate through the browser, you’ll notice redesigned icons, a The DuckDuckGo browser’s built-in Scam Blocker guards against phishing sites, malware, and other common online scams. It’s free, anonymous, and on by default, so you’re protected as soon as you open the browser. DuckDuckGo’s approach to AI is to provide private, useful, and optional AI features – including chat and search instant answers – to people who want the productivity benefits of AI without the privacy risks. 2024 marks DuckDuckGo's 14th year of donations—our annual program to support organizations that share our vision of raising the standard of trust online. We are proud to donate to diverse DuckDuckGo calls on the European Commission to launch three non-compliance investigations around Google’s obligations under the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA). With the core objective of supporting consumer privacy technologies, DuckDuckGo is now actively investing in early-stage companies as well as pursuing acquisitions and partnerships. As a company that operates a search engine that directly competes with Google, we have several ideas about how to craft a set of legal and technical interventions that can, in combination, effectively curb the advantages Google has gained through illegal use of their search monopoly. DuckDuckGo AI Chat is an anonymous way to access popular AI chatbots – currently, GPT 3.5 Turbo, Claude 3 Haiku, and open-source models Llama 3 and Mixtral 7x8B, with more to come. This optional feature is free to use, within a daily limit. Privacy Pro bundles three new DuckDuckGo protections for one low price. Get a secure non-logging VPN; Personal Information Removal, which helps remove your information from people search sites; and Identity Theft Restoration, which helps to fix credit report mistakes and recover financial losses. Sync bookmarks, passwords, and Email Protection settings between DuckDuckGo browsers on phones, tablets, and computers, privately and securely. DuckDuckGo is now carbon negative dating back to our founding in 2008 through 2020, and is committed to being carbon negative in perpetuity. 2023 marks DuckDuckGo's 13th year of donations— our annual program supporting organizations that are raising the standard of trust online. Founder and CEO, Gabriel Weinberg, celebrates DuckDuckGo's past, present, and future. Make the internet less creepy and less cluttered with our desktop browser for Windows—now in public beta! DuckDuckGo for Windows is fast, secure, and packed with the privacy protections you know and trust from our iOS, Android, and Mac browsers. DuckDuckGo launches DuckAssist, an AI-enhanced Instant Answer that generates natural language answers to search queries using Wikipedia 2022 marks DuckDuckGo's twelfth year of donations—our annual program to support organizations that share our vision of raising the standard of trust online.
