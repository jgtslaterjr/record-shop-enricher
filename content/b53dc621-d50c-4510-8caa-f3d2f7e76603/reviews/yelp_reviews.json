Their selection is amazing, their lounge is great, and the prices are good CONS: the guy at the counter was grouchy and very introverted when we came inOVERALL: I don't think the hospitality was good but if you're just looking for a record than this is the spot to come to",

I tried to look through the vinyl records but the store smelled of cigarettes and the smoke smell was so strong that I had to go outside and wait until my son was through shopping. I'm normally one who wants to flip through all the records in hopes to find that album I have been searching for but this wasn't the place for me.",

Friend couldn't make it back to pick it up, so the owner shipped it to us - for free, even after we offered to pay by venmo!  What an amazing person and what an amazing record store.  I could not have found that vinyl record anywhere.  5 stars!",
