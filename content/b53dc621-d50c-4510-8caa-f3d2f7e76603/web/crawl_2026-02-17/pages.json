The season kicks off with the Gettysburg Wine & Music Festival, followed by the beloved National Apple Harvest Festival, a two-weekend celebration of apples, artisans, and small-town fun.

What is the weather like in Gettysburg during the fall? Fall weather in Gettysburg is mild, comfortable, and ideal for exploring. You can expect crisp mornings, warm afternoons, and cool evenings; the kind of days that make you want to stay outside a little longer. Early fall often brings daytime highs in the 60s to low 70s, cooling into the 50s as the season moves into November. When packing for your fall getaway, layers are key. A light sweater or thinner jacket is perfect for the morning chill and easy to shed once the sun warms things up midday.

Many attractions also host seasonal activities for kids: from hayrides to Halloween events, making it an ideal time for a weekend getaway. Are fall weekends busy in Gettysburg? October is one of Gettysburg’s most popular months, so it’s a good idea to book your lodging early if you’re planning a fall visit. While weekends bring more activity with festivals, events, and visitors exploring downtown, it’s not “big city busy.” You’ll find a friendly mix of locals and travelers enjoying the season, enough energy to make the town feel alive, but never so crowded that it takes away from Gettysburg’s small-town charm. There’s a comfortable buzz that makes the town feel welcoming and alive, yet it’s still easy to enjoy an intimate, relaxed getaway: lingering over coffee at a local café, chatting with shop owners and visitors, or catching live music in the square. It’s the perfect balance between community and calm, where you can meet new people without ever feeling lost in a crowd. Is Gettysburg close to other fall destinations? Absolutely!
