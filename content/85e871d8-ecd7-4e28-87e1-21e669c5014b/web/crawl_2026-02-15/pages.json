Cinematic and romantic, the album blends jazz, lounge, indie pop, and both traditional English and Latin American folk styles. The title translates to \"Soft Rains Will Come\" and that's a good encapsulation of the vibe of this album: gentle, strong, joyful, and optimistic. A quietly powerful, defiantly hopeful, absolutely lovely album. CD $16.98 Getting Killed (CD) Geese Geese are not the type of band to play it safe. Their latest, Getting Killed , is wildly experimental, filled with twists and turns, and just straight up exciting. Opener \"Trinidad\" starts off like a distorted '70s R&B moodpiece before bursting into full-on punk rock chaos. It's thrilling and a good introduction to this kooky album. \"100 Horses\" is unhinged psych rock, \"Taxes\" sounds like a confessional folk crooner discovering The Stooges midway through the song. Expect the unexpected on the fascinating, fantastic Getting Killed . CD $16.98LP $29.98 Deadbeat (CD) Tame Impala Tame Impala's Deadbeat is some of singer/songwriter/multi-instrumentalist Kevin Parker's best work. It's also a bit of an evolution in sound from Tame Impala's last album, with its low-key electronica/chillwave vibes. Parker calls it \"club-psych,\" which is an apt description for the woozy psych-folk-meets-dancefloor beats of the album. These ravey, electronic elements bring a blissed out, energizing feel to the work, even as Parker's lyrics and vocal melodies bring a yearning and poignancy to the proceedings. Deadbeat takes Tame Impala in exciting, innovative new directions. CD $16.98LP $42.98LP $44.98 EP #2 [Red Vinyl] (LP) Kings Of Leon The latest from Kings Of Leon is irresistible. EP #2 also feels like an evolution: the band still writes ultra-catchy hooks but there's something about this release that gets deeper under the skin than ever before. Maybe it's the haunting western twang and the wistful edge of uncertainty in Caleb Followill's voice on \"To Space.\" Or the swirling psychedelic flourishes on the biting \"All the Sheep,\" the stripped-down and vulnerable country rock of \"Pit to the Rind.\" You've got to hear it for yourself because this is some of the best work Kings of Leon has ever done. LP $19.98 Empty Hands [Pink In Ice Blue w/Splatter Vinyl] (LP) Poppy Poppy returns with a powerful and cathartic new album, Empty Hands . A potent blend of metal, punk, and industrial, the tracks are as unrelenting and razor sharp as their lyrics. Ignorance, cruelty, and indifference all fizzle under Poppy's vulcanic gaze...and damn, does it feel good. Empty Hands packs a punch. It's vital, searing, and inspiring in its ferocity. LP $39.98CD $16.98LP $39.98 45 Pounds [Yellow Vinyl] (LP) YHWH Nailgun It's impossible to ignore YHWH Nailgun. On 45 Pounds , the NYC experimental rock four-piece has created an inimitable sound that draws on noise, punk, and electronic genres, yet feels totally uncategorizable. Filled with searing synths, discordant melodies, and hostile growls, it's an unsettling, rousing, and deeply exciting listen. 45 Pounds is fierce, smart, and uncompromising — if you're a fan of boundary-pushing, abrasive noise and avant-garde punk, this record will feel like a breath of fresh air. LP $29.98 Boycott Heaven [Ceramic Blue Vinyl] (LP) The Format The Format are back with their first album in (whoa) two decades. Boycott Heaven will remind you of everything you loved about the band, and if you've never encountered them before, you're in for a treat. Urgent and earnest, the album takes an unflinching look at what's going on in the world while shoring up hope for a better future. Power chords drive the tracks, vulnerability shines through, and a belief in the quiet power of personal relationships and community brings a centered quality to even the most dire moments. If you dig indie rock and early '00s alt, this one's for you. CD $13.98LP $29.98 Spirit! (CD) HUNNY Hunny's third album is a welcome dose of sunny pop to help get us through the rest of winter. The band has become a solo project for frontman Jason Yarger, who deftly blends indie pop with catchy dance grooves and nods to emo. There are instant earworms like \"POV ur dead and i'm checking my hair in ur sunglasses\" with its shout along chorus and funky bass, but elsewhere there are more introspective, guitar-driven gems. \"spam calls\" thrives on its dynamics moving from wistful verses to euphoric choruses. \"all of a suddenly\" rocks out with a touch more angst while still remaining upbeat. It's a highly enjoyable set. CD $14.98LP $29.98 Running With Scissors [Sky Blue Vinyl] (LP) Cavetown Cavetown's Running With Scissors is an intriguing blend of glitchy electronics and driving indie rock. The melodies are richly-textured and sometimes a bit experimental: you never know where these songs will go, and that's half the delight in listening. The other half is the way Cavetown moves from vulnerable admissions to cathartic crescendos. There's something deeply relatable in these ultra catchy tracks, so relatable, in fact, it often feels like we're catching a glimpse of someone else's closed door moments. CD $16.98LP $34.98 Piss In The Wind (LP) Joji Joji's Piss In The Wind is a lot dreamier than you'd expect from its irreverent title. The songs blend woozy trap, earnest folk, moody electronic, and a bit of R&B; Joji's voice segues effortlessly from pensive, wistful falsetto to a melancholic lower range. The genre-hopping feels innovative and interesting, while the emotional depth is what goes straight to the heart. It's easy to get swept up in these beautiful, atmospheric tracks. You'll want to revisit this impressive album again and again. LP $34.98CD $16.98 Liquorice (CD) Hatchie Australian indie pop artist Hatchie's Liquorice is a swirling, shimmering dream of an album. Shoegaze and dreampop sounds are the perfect vessel for Hatchie's lyrical themes of longing, love, and regret. Melodies soar with dizzying euphoria, they capture the inner turbulence of uncertainty and desire. Hatchie recorded the album in Los Angeles with Melina Duterte (aka Jay Som) and it's a lovely, hopelessly romantic, gut punch of a record. CD $16.98LP $29.98LP $29.98 In Search Of A Revival [Sky Blue Vinyl] (LP) The Olympians The Olympians are back. In Search of a Revival is a fitting name for this evocative, retro-flavored album; after all, it has been almost a decade since the Daptones act's last album, time which maestro Toby Pazner spent raising a family and touring as a keyboard player with and writing songs alongside Lee Fields. It was time well-spent. Revival is lush and heady, calling to mind vintage film soundtracks, swingin' lounge sounds, and a cosmic fusion of jazz and R&B. A dazzling and deeply enjoyable album.

If you dig indie rock and early '00s alt, this one's for you. CD $13.98LP $29.98 Deadbeat (CD) Tame Impala Tame Impala's Deadbeat is some of singer/songwriter/multi-instrumentalist Kevin Parker's best work. It's also a bit of an evolution in sound from Tame Impala's last album, with its low-key electronica/chillwave vibes. Parker calls it \"club-psych,\" which is an apt description for the woozy psych-folk-meets-dancefloor beats of the album. These ravey, electronic elements bring a blissed out, energizing feel to the work, even as Parker's lyrics and vocal melodies bring a yearning and poignancy to the proceedings. Deadbeat takes Tame Impala in exciting, innovative new directions. CD $16.98LP $42.98LP $44.98 EP #2 [Red Vinyl] (LP) Kings Of Leon The latest from Kings Of Leon is irresistible. EP #2 also feels like an evolution: the band still writes ultra-catchy hooks but there's something about this release that gets deeper under the skin than ever before. Maybe it's the haunting western twang and the wistful edge of uncertainty in Caleb Followill's voice on \"To Space.\" Or the swirling psychedelic flourishes on the biting \"All the Sheep,\" the stripped-down and vulnerable country rock of \"Pit to the Rind.\" You've got to hear it for yourself because this is some of the best work Kings of Leon has ever done. LP $19.98 Piss In The Wind (LP) Joji Joji's Piss In The Wind is a lot dreamier than you'd expect from its irreverent title. The songs blend woozy trap, earnest folk, moody electronic, and a bit of R&B; Joji's voice segues effortlessly from pensive, wistful falsetto to a melancholic lower range. The genre-hopping feels innovative and interesting, while the emotional depth is what goes straight to the heart. It's easy to get swept up in these beautiful, atmospheric tracks. You'll want to revisit this impressive album again and again. LP $34.98CD $16.98 In Search Of A Revival [Sky Blue Vinyl] (LP) The Olympians The Olympians are back. In Search of a Revival is a fitting name for this evocative, retro-flavored album; after all, it has been almost a decade since the Daptones act's last album, time which maestro Toby Pazner spent raising a family and touring as a keyboard player with and writing songs alongside Lee Fields. It was time well-spent. Revival is lush and heady, calling to mind vintage film soundtracks, swingin' lounge sounds, and a cosmic fusion of jazz and R&B. A dazzling and deeply enjoyable album.
