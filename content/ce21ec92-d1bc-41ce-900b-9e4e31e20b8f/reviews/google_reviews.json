It’s the extra stuff that ties the package together into a really great store. They have cleaning brushes and kits, new and used turntables, and a listening station with a Rega Planar 3 and Meze Audio headphones. Looking forward to coming back!",

I was in a car accident right outside their location, and without hesitation, several employees came outside to check on me and offer help.\nIn a moment of stress and shock, their kindness, calmness, and willingness to assist made a huge difference. Whether it was helping me stay calm, calling for help, or just showing genuine concern — their actions meant more than I can express.\nYou don’t expect strangers to step up like that, but they did — and it shows what kind of people work at this business. I’ll never forget their support and compassion that day. Thank you again for going above and beyond. You all have made all the difference for me.\n—Arielle",

I honestly didn’t expect much, but when I got home and played the albums, they played flawlessly. I’m shocked (in the best way)!\n\nThe staff were super friendly and helpful...just great guys all around. They’ve definitely got a new customer in me, and I’ll be stopping by often as I continue to build my collection. I’ll update this post with names once I grab their business cards, but for now...major kudos to the whole team!\n\nHighly recommend checking them out if you’re into vinyl.",

The gentleman that was there was very nice, and offered to give me a quick little breakdown of the location - which was a nice gesture but I was deadset on the CD's. It looks like they have set up an area for live shows - so it'll be nice to see how that evolves. Please note that this place requires you going up a set of stairs. The entrace is on the back/side of the building (look for signs).\n\nThe selections and prices are within reason. Some items I felt were slightly overpriced, but nothing egregious. They had a nice small variety, with a lot of your typical artists, bands, and albums.  I am seeing that they are still working on putting out inventory, so it's worth revisiting!\n\nI did end up buying a few items - however The Roots album I purchased ended up having a Toby Keith cd instead. Not the best surprise. I didn't go back since it's far from where I live and by the time I discovered that issue it was far too late in the day - and I just didn't want to go through all that for $4.00. Partially on me for not looking first, but I would also ask that they review their used CD's before putting them out.",
