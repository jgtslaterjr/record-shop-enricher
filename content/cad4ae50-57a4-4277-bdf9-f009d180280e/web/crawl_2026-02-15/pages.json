    "text": "Sam Spencer 9/5/23 Sam Spencer 9/5/23 What's Pressing: Wheatie Mattiasich - Old Glow LP Recorded during the first two years of the pandemic and in collaboration with Stephen Santillan, “Old Glow” by Baltimore’s Wheatie Mattiasich is an eerily enchanting yet spacious embrace of experiences that is now available on vinyl through Bill Nace’s label Open Mouth Records.On the track “Canyon” Wheattie delves into more of a rock tangent while on the track “Rose” there is more of a focus on country elements. Despite there being an overarching theme of folk-centered ethereal energy, there are defined moments meant to bring you back to reality on its own terms. Her vocals at times play the role of another layer of instrumentation, feeling light and far yet central to the foundation of the music. Almost completely sold out in both runs of 200 pressings, this album has an unmistakable way of defining its own boundaries so that it is not easily placed into genre-descriptors. Fans of Wheatie know that to see her perform live is a rare & humbling experience, and we at Softwax put everything into making sure that this vinyl matches the masterful weaving of sounds Wheatie is so highly regarded for. If you’re looking to get your hands on a copy, head over to Open Mouth Records Bandcamp, at the time of publishing there are still a few available for purchase. Read More Sam Spencer 8/11/23 Sam Spencer 8/11/23 From The Archive: Death Grips - No Love Deep Web Death Grips' \"No Love Deep Web\" is a deadeye-on-the-train confrontational album that explores what it means to stand in contrast. Released in 2012, the album features the unsubtly aggro and distortion-intensive production of Zach Hill and Andy Morin accompanied by MC Ride's wound-prodding rhapsodizing.The album opens with \"Come Up and Get Me,\" a track that sets the pace for the rest of the album with a rest-rephrensive flurry. The lyrics touch on ideations of paranoia and isolation, with MC Ride's adding to the sense of undermined comfortability with guttural vocals. Tracks like \"No Love\" and \"World of Dogs\" feature heavy sledgehammer swing beats and abrasive, stripped instrumentation, letting chaos gush.The album's standout tracks, such as \"Lock Your Doors\" and \"Artificial Death in the West,\" continue to explore the album's themes of power and control, with lyrics that touch on the dangers of authority and conformity.Overall, \"No Love Deep Web\" is a showcase of challenging norms in the Hip-Hop genre. Death Grips' isolationist and uncompromising vision is truly an evolution in what one has come to expect from experimental tangents. The album is not for the faint of heart, but for those who can hang, it is a rewarding and indoctrinating listen. We were able to press 10,000 copies of this 10th anniversary edition on the ever-classic coke-bottle clear vinyl, including an alternate cover (we like it just as much as the original) as well as a printed inner sleeve. For fans of Death Grips, this repressed LP is a must have and we at Softwax are proud to have been the ones to have recreated it. Read More Sam Spencer 8/4/23 Sam Spencer 8/4/23 From The Archive: Erykah Badu - But You Cain't Use My Phone Originally released in November of 2015 on Motown/Control Freaq, “But You Cain’t Use My Phone” was inspired in part as a further dive into Badu’s seminal 2008 track “Telephone”.The song was inspired by the passing of her friend and legendary producer J Dilla, and it reappears as a tribute to DJ Screw, another late rap producer on \"But You Cain’t Use My Phone.\" In this mixtape, Badu views phones as more than mundane gadgets; she sees them as mystical devices connecting different realms and emotions. Phones can facilitate profound communication but also create misunderstandings and distractions, reflecting a range of emotions, from heartbreak to lust, intelligence to foolishness.Created in just 12 days with producer Zach Witness, the tape captures an off-the-cuff feel while incorporating depth and wisdom. It pays homage to the past, including Drake's \"Hotline Bling,\" a song that draws from Timmy Thomas' 1972 track \"Why Can't We Live Together.\" Badu's mixtape spans four decades of phone-related pop, intertwining her unique style with other artists' influences.While Badu favors the old-school, pre-cellphone era, she also acknowledges the allure of modern technology. \"Phone Down\" urges someone to disconnect from the digital world and embrace real-life experiences, but the somber tone suggests it might be too late.The mixtape concludes with a revamped version of \"Hello It's Me,\" featuring André 3000, the father of Badu's son. Despite their past breakup, they remain connected and collaborate on art. As the song fades, their voices come together, symbolizing an ongoing conversation.In summary, \"But You Cain’t Use My Phone\" is a reflective mixtape by Erykah Badu, blending her signature style with a diverse range of influences. Through her music, she explores the mystical and emotional aspects of phones while paying tribute to the past and cherishing meaningful connections.We did two separate runs of this record for a total of almost 8,000 opaque purple records. As far as Badu albums go, this mixtape is an underrated gem in her discography that we are stoked to have been a part of its rebirth on vinyl. Read More Sam Spencer 7/21/23 Sam Spencer 7/21/23 What's Pressing: Ice Spice - Like..? For those that still need an introduction to the newly-crowned empress of the Bronx, Ice Spice rose to fame in the past two years for her signature style of schematic lyrics & drill beats that are loaded with cultural relevance. Overlayed with the self-assured attitude only an NYC native can pull off, she shines through her ability to cultivate and stamp her own linguistic mark within the Hip-Hop genre. Executive produced alongside her musical partner RiotUSA, the album features gem after gem of samples she accompanies with her verses, be that the Spongebob OST on “Bikini Bottom” or the Puff Daddy sample on “Gangsta Boo” Ice Spice is blazing her own trail of strong but cutesy independence and we at Softwax are proud to produce a record that keeps that same energyPressed on an aptly picked bright orange variant, we produced 4200 units in her signature color, and another 4000 in classic black. Whether or not we consider ourselves a munch is beside the point, we love Ice Spice. Read More Sam Spencer 6/30/23 Sam Spencer 6/30/23 from the archive: Erykah badu - worldwide underground Since we opened our doors for production in January 2020, securing contracts for a series of represses with the legendary Erykah Badu was something that motivated us to step up our game. Despite our crew of employees varying in taste & preference, one thing we all agreed on was that Ms. Badu was and is the undisputed queen. Badu, for those who aren’t acquainted with her, started her music career in 1997 with the release of her freshman project Baduizm which received critical acclaim and earned her the designation “Queen of Neo-soul”. \"Worldwide Underground\" is the third studio album by Badu, released in 2003. The album features a blend of soul, funk, and hip-hop, with elements of jazz and world music. The album received critical acclaim and was a commercial success, reaching the top ten on the US Billboard 200 chart. The album doesn’t lead you down the rabbit hole of metaphorical questioning, it is confidently in your face with its messaging, which is represented well in the cover art. The album includes collaborations with several notable artists, including rapper Common, jazz trumpeter Roy Hargrove, and legendary funk musician George Clinton. The tracks feature airborne-level infectious rhythms and grooves, with Badu's signature soulful vocals and socially conscious lyricism.Some standout tracks on the album include \"Danger,\" which features a sample from Fela Kuti's \"Fear Not for Man,\" and \"Back in the Day (Puff),\" paying homage to the golden age of hip-hop. \"I Want You\" is a humid ballad with a jazzy feel, while \"Bump It\" is a funk-driven track with an unforgettable hook.Overall, \"Worldwide Underground\" is an expansive while simultaneously well-polished album that showcases Badu's versatility as an artist. The album's eclectic blend of genres and collaborations with other artists create a deeply comforting sonic experience that is both refreshing and classic. We were lucky enough to do two separate represses of WWU, totalling almost 10,000 units using an impressively fitting opaque purple vinyl. This project has been released and is available for purchase at a record store near you. Read More news Federico Casanova 6/13/23 news Federico Casanova 6/13/23 Who are we? Why we are. Are we even really hear? [working title] Softwax began in 2015 at a house show in Philadelphia. We didn’t start pressing records on our own until 2020, and we couldn’t have imagined the path would take us to where we are today… Softwax began in 2015 at a house show in Philadelphia. We didn’t start pressing records on our own until 2020, and we couldn’t have imagined that we would be where we are today. The first few years posed an unprecedented test of resilience and we needed to demonstrate our ability to adapt and innovate. Our dreams of ONLY working with independent artists went out the window and we ended up pressing records for giant labels we had no business working for. But it actually made us better. We grew fast, and had to learn what it takes to produce the highest-quality records at scale … It ensured we could stay open. By making strategic partnerships with major labels, we could weather the storm and continue providing the highest caliber products to our cherished clientele, independent artists and independent labels. Today, in 2023, with the experience of pressing hundreds of thousands of records, with a killer crew, and an extremely supportive community, we feel like it is time to refresh our visual identity to match how much we’ve grown. We are very pro",
