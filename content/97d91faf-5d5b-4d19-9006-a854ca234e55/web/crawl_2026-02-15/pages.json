    "text": "View fullsize AboutRepo Records was opened by Dan Matherson in 1986 in Wayne, PA. A second shop opened in Bryn Mawr in 1989, both specializing in punk rock and indie LPs, CD's and cassettes. In 1998, Repo opened it’s doors at 538 South street where we stayed until 2017. When an opportunity arose to move into a bigger storefront on our block, we jumped at the chance to pack up our expanding inventory and start fresh yet again at 506 South Street (the old home of Agent Aloha). We are now in our 38th year and have expanded into hosting events and more!Repo is a smallish shop but we've got a wide variety of music, both new and used, ranging from metal to jazz, punk rock to hip hop, soul, r&b, indie, and classic rock, you name it. We're always on the lookout for used records and Cd's, call us at anytime to set up a meeting...or just come on in!

Outside of her home, she is a deviant; inside of her home, she is free.The album comes February 27, but record stores around the world are opening the door to that home -- Tansy House -- on FEBRUARY 21 for TANSY HOUSE LISTENING EVENTS. You're invited to bring your favorite pens, stickers and crafting supplies and settle in for an advance listen to the new album and some creative time with your thoughts and impressions of the music. Then put it all together for a community art project that may just be featured on the @mitskiverseOf course, there will be free giveaways -- souvenirs and reminders of the time you spent with friends as you #listentomitski -- and a prize too. And you'll be able to order the new record and get a limited edition sticker on street date *while supplies last. Slide through to find the store you'll visit and check in with them for times and more details.
