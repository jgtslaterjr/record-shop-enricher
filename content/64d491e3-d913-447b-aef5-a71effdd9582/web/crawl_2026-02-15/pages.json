    "text": "About Lot 49 Books Fishtown, Philadelphia's Literary Destination Since 2023 Contact Us Talk about your brand Lot 49 Books was founded in 2021 out of the first floor of a house in South Philadelphia. An avid reader and lifelong haunt of brick-and-mortar bookstores, owner Drew Waldo was inspired after reading a Lawrence Ferlinghetti biography describing improvised bookstores in post-war Europe. The store moved to Fishtown in 2023.Named after Thomas Pynchon's novel, \"The Crying of Lot 49,\" the store offers new and used books, focusing on literary fiction, poetry, art books, political histories, and zines. There are no other \"Pynchonian\" themes to the store, though as a small store with a goal towards good curation the book selection has its niches.In addition to bookselling, Lot 49 hosts events ranging from poetry workshops and readings to art and music shows. It is a true privilege to take part in the vibrant writing and music scenes in Philadelphia as a host. Check the events page on the website for our next event.We encourage customers to sell books to Lot 49 for cash or store credit.",
