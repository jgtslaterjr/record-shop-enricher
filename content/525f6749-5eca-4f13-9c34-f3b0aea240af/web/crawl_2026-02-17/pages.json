    "text": "Eryn \"I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar that much is true...\" OK so that’s not entirely true… Jason & I met at a Kansas high school in the 80’s. I was a full time babysitter, hanging out in the local punk scene, & dabbling in interior design & visual arts when he began making mix tapes for me. Those perfect mixes sent me to heaven & I knew right then that I had found the love of my life. Our story... Jason \"You were working as a waitress in a cocktail bar when I met you...\" Well maybe that’s not exactly the way it happened, but you get the idea. Truth be told I was folding towels in a hotel laundry, playing in a band, & pursuing my studies in piano & composition when I met Eryn. Her first gift to me was a B-52's album... it was obvious that I had found my soul mate & that we would be spending the rest of our musical lives together. Us We were both working at local music shops in Kansas & when the opportunity came along to move closer to the coast, we sold the farm and headed east. Landing in Philadelphia, we spent years working for Rainbow Records & then Chester County Book & Music Company. When that chapter of our lives ended, we took the opportunity to realize our dream of opening our own record store. & so… Electric Avenue was born. Electric Avenue When we conceived the idea of Electric Avenue, we wanted to create a space for people who really love music and movies to have access to own what they love in physical forms, and to gather and discuss what they like in a face-to-face place. Humans respond to different types of music for different reasons, and we take pride in putting that special album or video right into your hands whenever we can. No matter what you are looking for, we will do our best to track it down (within reason, of course), and we want to help you any way we can. It is widely acknowledged that music and video is more of an experience when you have a real copy in your hands. Why else would vinyl records be experiencing their renaissance? As for CDs and DVDs/Blu-ray, they are portable, have great sound and video resolution, and always say more about an individual and what they stand for when part of their environment. With physical items, you will likely take more of a chance to discover and love that new-to-you art, and you will be less likely to throw them away when you move on to something else (although they do actually have resale value). They will stand as documents of where you were at that moment in time, what moved you, and what you would like others to be exposed to as well. It is a great feeling when you can pinpoint exactly where you were when you bought that special album or received your favorite movie as a gift. We also created a customer rewards program that is free to join, and every time you spend $150, you receive a $10 bonus credit against your purchase. Returning customers are very important to us, and we feel they should be rewarded for their loyalty. We did not undertake this venture lightly, as we believe in music and film as reflections of our thoughts and emotions as human beings. The bottom line is, we want our customers to enjoy our products as much as we enjoy delivering it to them. Whether they make you laugh, cry, or discover something about yourself you never thought existed before, that’s the power of art, and we think it’s a special thing to be able to say ‘This is who I am and what I enjoy. Maybe you will find pleasure in it too.’",
