We buy vinyl records, cassettes, and CDs. We’re interested in well-loved collections across all genres. We typically don’t buy much classical music, but we do make exceptions for 20th-century composers and avant-garde artists like Philip Glass, Suzanne Ciani, Steve Reich, and Terry Riley.How can I sell you my records?Just drop by the shop, no appointment needed. You're welcome to hang out and browse while we check out your collection. Have a large collection or something tough to transport? We also do house calls — just get in touch to schedule a visit. What kind of music do you specialize in?We specialize in discovery. We’re not just a record shop, we’re a space built to help you explore music across eras, genres, and continents. Our jazz collection is organized in a way that traces the genre from the early swing and big band era, through the spacious and laid back sounds of cool jazz, to the fast complexities of bebop and the innovative compositions of the free jazz and avant-garde movement. Our rock section follows a timeline, beginning with early R&B and rockabilly of the 1950s, progressing through the golden era of classic rock in the '60s and '70s, then to the punk and metal scenes of the '80s, followed by the rise of alternative and indie in the '90s and 2000s, and all the way up to today’s artists, who are pushing genre boundaries like never before. If you’re a fan of reggae and dub, you’ll find early Jamaican “oldies,” like ska and rock steady, classic dub records, UK sound system culture, and today’s modern roots revival. As one of Philadelphia’s best record stores for vinyl, we curate our bins to help you find exactly what you’re looking for, plus something you don’t know. Whether you're searching for rare jazz LPs, classic punk albums, indie rock gems, or obscure experimental releases, every visit promises a new discovery.Can you get me a record you don’t have in stock?Yes, yes, yes. We special order titles for customers all the time. We work with a wide range of distributors and labels, so if it’s in print, we can likely get it for you.
