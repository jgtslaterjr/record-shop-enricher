    "text": "ABOUT THE QUEEN OURCommonWEALTH Venue’sHistory All hail her royal highness, The Queen! Originally built in the 1800s, “The Indian Queen Hotel” was a popular place for traveling sailors to spend the night. From 1916-1959, the hotel was repurposed into a movie theater and brought joy to thousands of locals. Sadly, it was abandoned and sat dormant for over 50 years. With water pouring through the ceilings, the walls caving in, and the façade crumbling, this majestic theater had become a faded memory of Market Street’s vibrant past. However, as all good leaders do, The Queen found her way back to the throne and reopened her doors to the people on April 1st, 2011. Today, a full scale live music venue, she stands as one of the most historic buildings and theaters in Wilmington, Delaware. HISTORY of the Queen 1789 The Indian Queen Hotel was built in 1789, popularized by sailors from visiting ships. July 4, 1797 A celebration of US freedom is held at a space in the hotel know as the Queen of Otaheite Tavern, named after the South Pacific island that had been visited by a Wilmington whaling vessel. 1829 Martin Van Buren, seven years prior to his Presidential election, visits The Queen 1847 Despite harsh economic conditions, hotel proprietor John Hall doubles the Queen’s capacity by making it three stories high. March 25, 1871 Artisan’s Bank and the First National Bank of Wilmington buy the Indian Queen as a combination headquarters, but decide to upgrade it to a first-class hotel, the Clayton House, at a price tag of $200,000. An additional two stories were added, bringing the building’s total height to five stories. 1916 The Clayton House gives way to a $250,000 movie theatre with enough seating in the auditorium and on the balcony for 2,000 people. April 1959 The movie theatre closes, showing House on Haunted Hill as its final film. The Queen remains dark for five decades. 2008 Wilmington-based real estate developers, the Buccini/Pollin Group, and the City of Wilmington discuss restoring The Queen into a fully operational performing-arts venue centered around live music. A deal is met and fundraising efforts for the $25 million project get underway. October 2009 Construction begins on The Queen, a 45,000 square foot theatre and live music venue with a spring 2011 opening date announced. 2010 Benefit concerts held by Light Up The Queen Foundation feature Wilmington resident David Bromberg and New Orleans native Trombone Shorty, who perform on the roof of the nearby ShopRite. November 2010 Demolition reveals three 10′ x 18′ murals still in excellent condition. Representing beauty, painting, and music, the murals were obstructed by soundproofing panels when The Queen was converted from a hotel to a theatre. April 1, 2011 The Queen opens its doors. The rest, as they say, is history. Since opening, The Queen has hosted noble live music with artists including: St. Vincent, Ben Harper, Ingrid Michaelson, Brian McKnight, Bob Mould, Animal Collective, Neutral Milk Hotel, Courtney Barnett, Dead Milkmen and Biz Markie. 1789 The Indian Queen Hotel was built in 1789, popularized by sailors from visiting ships.

Prev Next Light UpThe Queen The significance of the Queen’s reopening reaches far beyond its walls, symbolizing the tremendous commitment our community has to ensure that downtown Wilmington becomes a lively city where all arts venues, businesses, and restaurants thrive. The goal of the Foundation is simple — to build community through music. With the renovation complete, LUQ is committed to ensuring the Queen Theater is a catalyst that fosters life-long interest and appreciation for music and the arts. Through its outreach programs, it provides hands-on music programs to local schools and other non-profit organizations with limited arts-education funding. These programs give students the opportunity to discover and express their musical talents. LUQ served 3,000 local students in our first year through its Outreach Music Education Programs.
